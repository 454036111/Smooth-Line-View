<h1>Smooth line UIView</h1>

The goal of this project is to create a UIView that can generate smooth lines from touch input in a reasonably fast manner without moving to a more complex framework like OpenGL. 

Currently the smoothing is working but very slow with large amounts of points. I'm working on figuring out a faster way of calculating a spline from a set of points.
